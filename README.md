                                    How to Use SuperSheet

                        This app is designed for creating fast product CSV sheets

              Backend can be found here https://github.com/Chribtoper/Supersheet-Backend
            
              First, from the left sidebar, create a new sheet and enter the name
              you want to give to your sheet.

              After you name your sheet, select your sheet on the select bar located
              at the top of the page.

              Drag the image of the product you want to add to your sheet into
              the dropzone box.

              After you add your products, you can now select your product sheet
              on the left and then you can display and or download a .CSV file
              with all of the information relevant to the image already inserted
              into each row such as product ID, name, tags, and url.

              Deleting a product sheet:
              Select your sheet from the select bar located at the top of the page.
              Click on the 'Delete Product Sheet' button to delete your sheet.
